DRAE is an **open protocol for AI-mediated communication (AIMC)** that eliminates semantic miscommunication while preserving privacy.
It uses **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, **encrypted private context**, and **semantic integrity guarantees** to transform ambiguous messages into clear, recipient-specific interpretations — **without leaking sensitive data**.

> Think of it as *"Grammarly + Secure GPT + On-chain Trust Layer for Meaning"*.
